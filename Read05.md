## Reading Linked List
Linked List - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.

Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.

Node - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.

Next - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.

Head - The Head is a reference type of type Node to the first node in a linked list.

Current - The Current reference is a reference type of type Node that is currently being looked at. This node is traditionally used when traversing through a full linked list. When traversing, you typically reset the current to the head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.


## Big o

Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency
Big O(oh) notation is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. This efficiency is evaluated based on 2 factors:

 Running Time 

 Memory Space 
## 4 Key Areas for analysis:
**Input Size**

**Units of Measurement**

**Orders of Growth**

**Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case**



Big O: The worst case analysis of algorithm efficiency.

Running Time: The amount of time required for an algorithm to complete.

Memory Space: The amount of memory resources required for an algorithm to complete.

Input Size: Represented by the variable n, the total size of values used as parameters in an algorithm.

Big Omega: The best case analysis of algorithm efficiency.

Big Theta: The typical or random case used for analysis of algorithm efficiency.


# The best way to learn for me is to explain the details and ideas in depth and embody a realistic example of them
